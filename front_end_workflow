### Frontend Structure

#### 1. **Overall Project Structure**

- **/public**
  - Contains static files like `index.html`, where the React app mounts.

- **/src**
  - **/components**
    - Contains reusable UI components.
      - `Header`: Navigation and app title.
      - `Footer`: App information or links.
      - `Login`: User authentication form.
      - `Register`: User registration form.
      - `TodoList`: Displays the list of todos.
      - `TodoItem`: Individual todo display with actions.
      - `AddTodo`: Form to create new todos.

  - **/services**
    - Contains service files that handle API interactions.
      - `authService`: Manages user authentication and registration.
      - `todoService`: Manages CRUD operations for todos.

  - **/hooks** (optional)
    - Custom hooks for managing state and side effects (e.g., `useAuth`).

  - **App.js**: Main application component that sets up routing and renders other components.

  - **index.js**: Entry point for the React app.

  - **App.css**: Styles for the application.

### Workflow

#### 1. **User Authentication Workflow**

- **Registration Flow**
  - User navigates to the Register component.
  - User fills in their username and password.
  - On submission, the app calls `authService.register()`.
  - On success, redirect the user to the Login page or directly log them in.

- **Login Flow**
  - User navigates to the Login component.
  - User enters their credentials.
  - On submission, the app calls `authService.login()`.
  - On successful authentication, store the user’s token and redirect to the Todo List.

#### 2. **Todo Management Workflow**

- **Viewing Todos**
  - When the TodoList component mounts, it calls `todoService.getTodos()` to fetch the current user's todos.
  - Todos are displayed in a list format, with each todo rendered as a `TodoItem`.

- **Adding a Todo**
  - User fills in the AddTodo form with a task description.
  - On submission, the form calls `todoService.createTodo()`.
  - Upon successful creation, update the TodoList state to include the new todo, which automatically re-renders the list.

- **Editing a Todo**
  - User clicks an Edit button on a TodoItem.
  - The app displays an editable form (inline or in a modal) pre-filled with the current todo details.
  - User makes changes and submits the form.
  - The app calls `todoService.updateTodo()` to save changes.
  - On success, the updated todo replaces the old one in the TodoList.

- **Deleting a Todo**
  - User clicks a Delete button on a TodoItem.
  - The app calls `todoService.deleteTodo()` with the specific todo ID.
  - Upon successful deletion, remove the todo from the list displayed in the TodoList component.

#### 3. **User Experience (UX) Considerations**

- **Feedback Messages**
  - Show success or error messages (e.g., “Todo added successfully!” or “Login failed!”) to inform the user of the action results.

- **Loading States**
  - Implement loading indicators (e.g., spinners) while fetching todos or processing actions like adding or deleting a todo.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Ensure that the layout adjusts for different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Accessibility**
  - Use clear labels and focus management to support users with disabilities.
